# Parkyn-reflection

# What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

* Git workflow. It was easy last week. But I've found I make a mistake and then it seems very difficult to unwind/reset the mistake in order to start over.


# What concepts were clarified during the GPS? 

* I'm not sure that any particular concepts were clarified, except for "don't get the workflow wrong".  Because somehow the issue that had happened to me during the day, happened again in GPS. And it took us most of the session to unwind the issue (I'm not sure we got it right)

# What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

* Mostly I was asking about the assignment and then how to fix our branch structure. We we're really able to get focused on the assignment as the branch structure sucked up all the time.


# What still confuses you about Git?

* I think I'm good with the workflow after today's (non-guided) paring session. I'd like to learn more about how undo changes or branch issue. I've been reading different sites, but still need to research further.


# How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

* This was my first paring session ever. I think a more introduction to each of our roles in the beginning of the session would have been helpful. Neither of us had done paring before. Closer monitoring of the coding that were doing (especially early in the session) would have been helpful so that we wouldn't have dug such a deep hole.
