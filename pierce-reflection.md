# Jarrade Pierce Reflection 
1. I was struggling with understanding the correct definitions of the git commands.
also am still struggling to understand the conflict between merges.

2. One concept that was more clarified was what git clone really means. How we are actually fetching and merging at the same time.

3. I asked my pair a bunch of questions about how to use some git commands. I also asked the GPS lead how we go about resolving merge conflicts.

4. A lot still confuses me but I am a lot better than I was.

5. My first experience pairing was good although a bit slow. I want to work on moving a lot faster next time.
